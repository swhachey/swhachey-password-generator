# swhachey-password-generator

A password generator developed by swhachey

I was given a nice piece of front end with a button and location for text to appear.
I was able to program a function using javascript to generate a password for the user when they click the button. It prompts them to deliver 4 variables; number of characters, uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters. Then delivers a password within those parameters.
